boxadder
========

An app that calculates the sums of items in boxes and updates all other client instances about its changes. A test drive of Meteor, svg, and d3.js. There's a running instance at [boxadder.meteor.com](http://boxadder.meteor.com/).

This was developed and deployed with [Meteorite](https://github.com/oortcloud/meteorite), but should probably be fine running under plain Meteor.
